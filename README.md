# Startup Analyst Platform

## 🚀 Status: Backend API Ready for Frontend Development

The backend API is fully deployed and functional with mock implementations. The frontend can start development immediately.

## 📋 What's Ready

### ✅ Backend API (Fully Functional)
- **URL**: https://analyst-backend-549120538825.us-central1.run.app
- **Status**: Deployed and working
- **Features**: All endpoints implemented with mock responses

### ✅ API Documentation
- **File**: `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- **Content**: Complete endpoint reference with examples

### ✅ Quick Start Guide
- **File**: `FRONTEND_QUICK_START.md`
- **Content**: Essential information for frontend development

### 🔄 Agent Integration (In Progress)
- Real Python agents are being deployed
- Currently using mock implementations
- Will be updated once agents are ready

## 🎯 For Frontend Development (SYED)

### 1. Start with Mock Data
The backend currently returns realistic mock responses for all endpoints. This is perfect for frontend development.

### 2. Key Files to Review
- `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Complete API reference
- `FRONTEND_QUICK_START.md` - Quick start guide
- `test_api.sh` - Test script to verify API functionality

### 3. Authentication
Use debug headers for development:
```javascript
const headers = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'x-debug-role': 'startup', // or 'investor'
  'x-debug-startup-id': 'your-startup-id' // optional
}
```

### 4. Test the API
```bash
./test_api.sh
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Backend (Node.js/TypeScript)
- Express.js server
- Firebase Authentication
- Firestore database
- Google Cloud Storage
- Deployed on Cloud Run

### Agents (Python)
- Flask servers
- LangChain integration
- Deployed on Cloud Run
- Currently using mock implementations

### Frontend (To be built)
- Will integrate with the backend API
- Can start development immediately

## 📊 Current Status

| Component | Status | URL |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| Backend API | ✅ Ready | https://analyst-backend-549120538825.us-central1.run.app |
| Agent Server | 🔄 In Progress | Mock implementations active |
| Frontend | ⏳ Ready to Start | TBD |

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Frontend Development**: Start building the UI using the API
2. **Agent Integration**: Complete the real agent deployment
3. **Testing**: End-to-end testing with real data
4. **Production**: Deploy to production environment

## 📞 Support

The backend API is fully functional and ready for frontend integration. All endpoints are documented and tested. Mock implementations provide realistic responses for development.

## 🔧 Development Notes

- All API responses are JSON
- Error handling: Check for `error` field in responses
- File uploads go directly to Google Cloud Storage
- Use polling for status updates (no WebSocket needed)
- Authentication is currently using debug headers

The platform is ready for frontend development!
